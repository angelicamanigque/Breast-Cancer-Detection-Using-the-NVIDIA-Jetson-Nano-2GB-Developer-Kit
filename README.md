# Breast Cancer Detection Using the NVIDIA Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit
## What does it do?
This project uses AI training to detect breast cancer. <br />
It compares images/ultrasound data to check if a tumor is benign (harmless) or malignant (harmful), or if the scan is normal and does not have a tumor at all. <br />

## Links you'll need:
The model I made on [roboflow](https://roboflow.com): https://app.roboflow.com/nvidia-jetson-nano-2gb/breast-cancer-detection/1 

## Hardware you'll need:
The Jetson 2GB Developer Kit <br />
5V Power Supply <br />
WiFi Router + Ethernet Cable <br />
Host Machine (ex. PC, Laptop) <br />

## Note:
Please please please make sure you have enough space on your Nano before beginning this project! It was my main issue I had while completing it. Please follow the directions for making a swap file to avoid any problems with getting into the roboflow docker. :)
