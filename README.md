# Breast Cancer Detection Using the NVIDIA Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit

## What does it do?
This project uses AI training to detect breast cancer. <br />
It compares images/ultrasound data to check if a tumor is benign (harmless) or malignant (harmful), or if the scan is normal and does not have a tumor at all. <br />

## Links you'll need:
The model I made on [roboflow](https://roboflow.com): https://app.roboflow.com/nvidia-jetson-nano-2gb/breast-cancer-detection/1 <br />
If you're a Windows user, I recommend using Putty to SSH into the Nano: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html <br />

## Hardware you'll need:
The Jetson 2GB Developer Kit <br />
5V Power Supply <br />
WiFi Router + Ethernet Cable <br />
Host Machine (ex. PC, Laptop) <br />
